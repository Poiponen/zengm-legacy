<p>Hockey GM is a completely free sports management simulation game. You are the general manager of a hockey team, tasked with building your roster to compete for a championship while managing your finances. As of now, your goal can be whatever you want: winning the most championships, making the most profit, developing players from rookies to stars, etc. You can make an unlimited number of different leagues from <a href="/">the dashboard</a>, each one with a different set of random players.</p>

<h2>User Interface</h2>

<p>From within a league, the most important user interface element is the Play Menu, which you can access with the big blue Play button at the top of the screen. Any context-dependent action, like playing a game or moving from one phase to another, is done from the Play Menu. Everything else about the user interface should (hopefully) be self-explanitory.</p>

<h2>Gameplay Overview</h2>

<p>Each season of the game is divided into several phases:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Preaseason.</b> Players develop/age (<i>i.e.</i> their ratings change). Young players tend to get better, old players tend to get worse.</li>
  <li><b>Regular season.</b> Regular season games are played, at the pace you choose through the Play menu.</li>
  <li><b>Playoffs.</b> Teams that made the playoffs progress through the bracket playing best-of-7 series until a champion emerges.</li>
  <li><b>Pre-draft.</b> After the playoffs end, you have one more chance to make changes to your roster before the draft, such as releasing a player to make room on your roster for a new player.</li>
  <li><b>Draft.</b> Similar to the NHL draft, teams are ordered from worst to best for from two to seven rounds.</li>
  <li><b>Post-draft.</b> After the draft, you have one more chance to make changes to your roster before free agency.</li>
  <li><b>Free agency.</b> Contracts expire. For players on your team, you will have the chance to negotiate a new contract with each player whose contract expires. Otherwise, players with expiring contracts become free agents. The same thing happens for the other teams, so the free agents list is most richly populated at this time.</li>
</ul>

<h2>League Rules</h2>

<p>League rules are generally modeled on the NHL, but simplified.</p>

<h3>Salary cap</h3>

<p>The salary cap is $71.4 million. This is a hard cap except in the case of injuries. In which case the injured players don't count against your cap.</p>

<p>There is also a minimum salary limit of $55.8 million. If you are below this limit, then you have to pay a penalty equal to the difference between your payroll and the limit.</p>

<h3>Contracts</h3>

<p>Their maximum contract amount is $14.28 million and the maximum contract length is 5 years.</p>

<p>The minimum contract amount is $575 thousand per year and the minimum contract length is 1 year (or, until the end of the season, if the season is already in progress).</p>

<p>When a contract expires, you have the opportunity to negotiate a new contract with the player. If you don't come to an agreement, the player becomes a free agent. </p>

<h3>Roster</h3>

<p>The maximum roster size is 23. The base draft is two rounds. Each additional round of the draft adds 5 spots for players in the minors up to a maximum of 23 spots. </p>

<p>The minimum roster size is 20. You must be above this limit to play games.</p>

<h2>Player Ratings</h2>

<p>Player ratings for a variety of categories (shooting, rebounding, passing, dribbling, etc.) are on a scale from 0-100. The whole scale is used, so a typical value for a rating is 50. Roughly, the overall ("ovr") player ratings mean:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>80s:</b> All-time great</li>
  <li><b>70s:</b> MVP candidate</li>
  <li><b>60s:</b> Good starter</li>
  <li><b>50s:</b> 2nd line</li>
  <li><b>40s:</b> 3rd line</li>
  <li><b>30s and lower:</b> Minors</li>
</ul>

<p>However, the overall ratings aren't a guarantee of performance. The particular mix of ratings plays into success (<i>e.g.</i> a short player having a 100 shot blocking rating doesn't do much), as do a player's teammates (<i>e.g.</i> a good rebounder doesn't help your team as much if you already have a few other good rebounders).</p>

<p>The potential ("pot") rating is also important. This is an estimate of the ceiling of the player's future overall rating. Just like in real life, most players never reach their ceiling, but some do reach it and some even exceed it. As a player with high potential grows older, it becomes less and less likely that he will ever reach his potential.</p>

<p>Also, you might notice that the height ("hgt") rating is not always proportional to the height in feet/inches of a player. So you might see a 6'0" player with 100 hgt and a 6'2" footer with 80 hgt. The hgt rating is what's used in the simulations. The heights in feet/inches are just for show. So hgt is really meant to also include things like wingspan and standing reach - basically how much a player's height/length impacts the game.</p>

<p>The displayed ratings are not the real ratings. They are estimates from your scouts. Increase the scouting budget to see more accurate ratings.</p>

<p>Finally, little symbols you see next to a player's name like <span class="skills-alone"><span title="Slapshot" class="skill">Ss</span><span title="Athlete" class="skill">A</span><span class="skill" title="Stickhandler">Sh</span><span title="Interior Defender" class="skill">Di</span><span class="skill" title="Perimeter Defender">Dp</span><span class="skill" title="Wristshot">Ws</span><span class="skill" title="Passer">Ps</span><span title="Rebounder" class="skill">R</span></span> represent the key skills a player has. This is designed so that you can just glance at a player and easily take in that information. To see what a symbol means, hover your mouse over it or consult this list:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A: Athlete</li>
  <li>Di: Interior Defender</li>
  <li>Dp: Perimeter Defender</li>
  <li>Ps: Passer</li>
  <li>R: Rebounder</li>
  <li>Ss: Slapshot</li>
  <li>Sh: Stickhandler</li>
  <li>Ws: Wristshot</li>
</ul>

<h2>How does it work?</h2>

<p>There are no accounts, no passwords, no nothing. All the game data is stored locally on your computer using <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=indexeddb">IndexedDB</a>. This has advantages and disadvantages. The main advantage is that it is really cheap to run this game, since simulations can occur in your web browser rather than a central server; this is what allows the game to be free and unlimited. The two main disadvantages are (1) doing simulations in your web browser incurs some performance restrictions (but it's not that bad), and (2) since the games are stored on your computer and not on a server, you can't access the same leagues on different computers (eventually this will be possible though).</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>

<p>Game simulation can be taxing on your computer, particularly as additional seasons are simulated and the database grows. There are a couple of tricks you can use to speed this up:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Don't open multiple windows/tabs viewing while you are simulating games. If you do, then all of the windows will try to update their content every day, which takes valuable computing resources away from actually simulating the games.</li>
  <li>Don't have a complicated page (such as the league dashboard) open when you simulate games. As the simulation progresses, the content of whatever you're viewing updates each day. If you're viewing something complex, this can be a little slow. For the fastest performance, view something old like the standings from a previous season which does not have to update ever.</li>
  <li>Within a league, go to Tools > Improve Performance.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Customized Rosters</h2>

<p>By default, all players are completely randomly generated. <a href="http://basketball-gm.com/manual/customization/">Click here for more info about custom rosters.</a></p>

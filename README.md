# ZenGM legacy games

This repo contains several games from [ZenGM](https://zengm.com/) which are no longer in active development. All original code (not including any bundled dependencies) is available under the Apache 2.0 license.

These games are all ports of [Basketball GM](https://basketball-gm.com/) to other sports, made by another developer who is no longer working on the project. [Basketball GM](https://basketball-gm.com/), [Football GM](https://football-gm.com/), and [ZenGM Hockey](https://hockey.zengm.com/) remain under heavy developpment, and their code has always been available [here](https://github.com/dumbmatter/gm-games). I do eventually want to bring all these other sports up to date with the latest version of Basketball GM, but that will be done from scratch (like I did in 2019 with football and 2021 with hockey) rather than using any of the code shared in this repository.

If you are so inclined, feel free play around with the code and make your own games, either based on these games or indirectly inspired by them.

Happy hacking!
